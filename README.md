# megabox
This is some code that goes along with my university final project at goldsmiths university that I've named mega box. The device is a motion based audio insrument and the code is written in C++ using the BELA IDE and supported libraries.

TO USE THE DEVICE UPLOAD THE CODE TO THE BELA IF NOT ALREADY DONE THEN TURN ON THE SWITCH AT THE BACK, MAKE SURE THE DEVICE'S AUDIO OUTPUT IS CONNECTED TO YOUR AUDIO INTERFACE OR LISTENING DEVICE AND WAIT UP TO 10 SECONDS, AT WHICH POINT THE DEVICE SHOULD START WORKING.

MAKE SURE THE DEVICE HAS BEEN CHARGED, CHARGE IT USING THE CHARGING SLOT AT THE BACK OF THE DEVICE
